# Description
-This project is basically a Compound Interest Calculator. My inspiration came from [this calculator](https://www.investor.gov/financial-tools-calculators/calculators/compound-interest-calculator) <br />
-As i'm an investor myself, i tend to use this calculator very often. The first time i used it i was perplexed by the power of compounding interest. I decided i had to make a calculator alike myself. <br />
-Here's my favourite quote from a famous investor: "My life has been a product of compound interest." - Warrren Buffet

# What i've learned
-This project is entirely written in Python. The interface was created using Tkinter library from standard libraries in Python. I decided to add some really cool graphs using MatPlotLib library to see the impact of compounding vs investing for one year or not investing the money at all; obviously, the larger the time horizon, the bigger the financial impact.

Compound interest is the interest on savings calculated on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods, also called "Interest of interest".

# How to use it
-You need to enter the initial amount to be compounded, the amount of years to be compounded and the annual interest rate. After that you click on 'Calculate' button  to see the sum after the years of compounding. <br />
-You can play with the arrows and see the initial amount after each year. <br />
-In the end you can observe the graph by clicking the 'Plot' button.
